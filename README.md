# Stock-analysis
**Green Energy Stock Analyisis for Steve and his family.**

**Overview***

In order to help Steve with his research we have used a database with 12 different green stocks which through coding it's being processed, ordered and calculated to achieve the performance of each stock during 2017-18 and assist Steven and his parents to make better investment decisions. The object of this challenge is to use all the VBA abilities learned in the module 2 to get an efficient code that processes the stock information with the less time and less waste of memory possible. Finally, it should be user friendly to be used by common people as Steve parents that focus on the results of the analysis and not that much about the code, for this we created a pair of buttons to easily execute and clear the calculations.

**Results of the stock performance 2017-18**

In first instance I processed the information of a single stock (DQ) in order to establish a good coding framework to work with, this allowed me to see if the final calculations were showing what I expecting of them, then building indexes and refactoring the code I applied the same calculations for the hole stocks sample in a more efficient and faster way than using the the initial code for each stock.

Given the results of the analysis as you can see below, it shows a sector with high volatility in the individual stocks which could make great gainings but also big loses. I can imagine that it's expected this kind of stocks be the future but as it is a new sector and need to gain creditiliby, the liquidity at that moment should be quite low, and this makes this kind of movements.

Refactoring by definition "is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior", I made this with the inicial code for the allstock analyisis to make a more efficient code using the calculation in arrays to improve time and memory

But if you check the hole perfomance of the QGREEN INDEX you can see that in total the the return/loss are lowers but also they have less volatility
 
**Statements**
Given the previous analysis I would recommend Steve and his parents to take in count that deversifying a fortfolio is a better way to achieve positive results in investments. Even if the returns in the green stock sector seem to be great, it's a sector with extremely high volatility and I would say also it has low liquidity and that's why the movements in prices are quite big. I would recomend to make an analysis of relative value to compare this
