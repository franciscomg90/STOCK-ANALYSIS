# Stock-analysis
Green Energy Stock Analyisis for Steve and his family.

Overview
In order to help Steve with his research we have used a database with 12 different green stocks which through coding it's being processed, ordered and calculated to achieve the performance of each stock during 2017-18 and assist Steven and his parents to make better investment decisions. The object of this challenge is to use all the VBA abilities learned in the module 2 to get an efficient code that processes the stock information with the less time and less waste of memory possible. Finally, it should be user friendly to be used by common people as Steve parents that focus on the results of the analysis and not that much about the code, for this we created a pair of buttons to easily execute and clear the calculations.

Results of the stock performance 2017-18
In first instance I processed the information of a single stock (DQ) in order to establish a good coding framework to work with, this allowed me to see if the final calculations were showing what I expecting of them, then building indexes and refactoring the code I applied the same calculations for the hole stocks sample in a more efficient and faster way than using the the initial code for each stock.
